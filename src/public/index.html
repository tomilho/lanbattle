          <h2>Quick Introduction</h2>
            <p>To play you'll need all players to use their phone as controllers and a display device, such as laptop or tv, as the shared display.
              It is recommend to use a large screen so all players can be comfortable to play.

            <h2>Creating the lobby</h2>
              <p>
                Simple click on "create a new party" button on the display device. You'll be redirected to
                a new page with a QR code. Simply scan the QR code with your phone and you'll join.

            <h2>üì±How to PlayüïπÔ∏è</h2>
            <p> Firstly, you must have your phone in üì± portrait orientation (that's when the phone is vertical) facing you. If you try
              to play in landscape mode, your tank will start to do flips in the slightiest movement. At the moment, you only
              have two interactions: üí• firing and üîÑ rotating. 
              <p>üí• To fire simply press anywhere on the page. </p>
              <p>üîÑ Rotating happens
              when you move your phone is tilted side to side (or, holding your phone, rotate your hand).

            <h2>‚ö†Ô∏èWIP‚ö†Ô∏è</h2>
            <p>This project is still a work-in-progress. Many key features are missing, such as rate limiter, rejoin after accidental
              phone lock and more, but I hope you at least enjoy playing this early build of the game :D.
